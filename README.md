## My personal page 
### [Live Site](http://www.majko-janolek.com/)

- This is my personal page created as MERN project with MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJS which I built from the scratch. 
- The page is completelly about me, my projects, my skills, my previous job and how to contact me.
- For frontend I used React library.
- As backend language I chose NodeJS.
- To store my data about projects I used MongoDB.
- For fetching data from my database I used axios library.
- To handle dark theme and multiple language I used context API hook.
- Styled components helped me to create all css and responsive design.
